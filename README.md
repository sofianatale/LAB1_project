# LAB1 Project
This project provides a computational workflow for the detection and classification of Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains in protein sequences, using a custom-built Profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM). 
Kunitz domains are conserved protein motifs important for physiological processes such as serine protease inhibition with downstream effects on immune defense, blood clotting and inflammatory response. 
The pipeline combine sequence and structural information to construct a high-quality HHM and applies a binary classification system to differentiate protein that encode Kunitz domain from those that do not. This repository enables users to build, evaluate and apply the model across diverse protein datasets.
